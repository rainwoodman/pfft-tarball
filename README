PFFT - Parallel FFT based on FFTW

Overview
--------
PFFT is a software library written in C for computing parallel fast Fourier  
transformations. 

For an introduction, please read the paper ''PFFT - An Extension of FFTW to
Massively Parallel Architectures'' available at 
  http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/preprint/2012/PREPRINT_06.pdf
At the moment, a detailed user guide to PFFT is not avialable. Nevertheless,
using PFFT is very similar to FFTW. The interface is as close to the fftw_mpi
interface as possible. Therefore, it is a good start to read FFTW manual:
  http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc
At least you should understand how FFTW deals with distributed memory FFTs:
  http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI.html#Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI
Next, you can have a look at the test programs in directory "tests" of the
source code to learn the details of the PFFT interface.

For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.

The most current general paper, and the one that we recommend if you wish 
to cite NFFT, is: The preprint by Pippig, M.
''PFFT - An Extension of FFTW to Massively Parallel Architectures'',
available at http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mathematik/preprint/2012/PREPRINT_06.pdf

Your comments are welcome! This is the third version of the library and may
not be as robust or well documented as it should be. Please keep track of bugs
